Project Inception

Introduction

Hello, My name is James Dix and my passion for technology stems early in my childhood. Although I would pursue  a career in the medical field as an Emergency Medical Technician. I came to understand that technology exist to the fullest in the Medical medicine and the use of it in everyday life has changed the world. I have always wanted to be on the other end of learning about new technology, meaning I wanted to be on the creation side of producing technology. 
My personal objectives for my proposed project are to create and application that will be simple, quick and effective per use. This will be a challenge that can be accomplished with research of similar applications and putting together a realistic plan to achieve my objectives.

Project Review

The first sample project that I researched was a networking system. LinkedIn. I was really impressed with the layout and functionality of the application. I have become fairly familiar with how LinkedIn works and there website, mobile application are something that I definitely use a reference to in the future. I do not plan on having in paid services on my application, but will I will offer some type of membership upgrade.

Project Review

Messaging systems have changed the way we communicate to each other around the world. Skype, FaceTime, and many other applications have added the luxury of video which I have personally benefited from on numerous locations. I do not plan on using any video capability in my application, but I will be incorporating a messaging system that will allow the user to create chat rooms similar to the GroupMe application. The real benefits from exploring these applications was for me to build a mental blueprint of what I want my project to provide. 


Conclusion

I think this application will be fun and challenging for me to complete. The entire concept of building something that I have a passion for inspires me to want to build the best application that I can. Although this will be a small sample size of what I plan on my project expanding to, I think that it is not something that I will not be able to accomplish. The challenging aspect of this project will be to create an interface, and writing code in C#, but I am more than willing to learn and face my challenges.
