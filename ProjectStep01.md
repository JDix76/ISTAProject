Title:Project 1

My name is James Dix, my passion for computers, and technology came later in life for me. However, solving problems and trying to figure out how to make things easier have always been something loved to do. Like many developers and future developers to come my personal objectives for this project stem from something that I have a passion for or has effected me at some point in my life. 

My personal objectives for this project are to develop an application that can give a person that loves to play basketball the ability to find a pick up game in the current city or city that they might be traveling to in the near future. Features in this project will include creating a membership, building group chat options similar to "Group Me" application, and the ability to update activity while at a current location which would be similar to the "Waze" application.

The first project that I reviewed was and auction system type of application. Ebay was my choice since I have been using is since 2003, in addition to being a member, I also have seen the improvements that have made to make things accessible, the change in functionality of the site and the simplicity of the transition to the mobile application. These are some major take-away that I can incorporate into my project. From personal experience I have taught people how to "Ebay" from just using my phone as demonstration device and they have become comfortable with purchasing merchandise from there.

Another project that I would be interested in doing would to build some application directed towards students in a small groups. Students in a large class room would be to use it as well, but for this situation I'm going use my current situation as and example. Currently my small group is using an application to ask questions, and communicate study hall places and time. My vision would to be have an application specifically designed to be able to attach files, create events and share location with other without scrolling through 23 unread messages.

In summary after reviewing an already known popular application like Ebay and a project that is a messaging based system similar to Twitter. I can use the take-aways listed be above to confidently say that on paper my objectives can lead to success if  organized correctly. I also know that I have to be ready to accept some failures and unexpected changes to my project when the time comes.
