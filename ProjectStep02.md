Introduction

Hello, my name James Dix and this paper will the second part of required written documentation to my proposed project plan. Before I indulge into the specifics of my project I would like to give a summary on why I have chosen to attempt to develop this project. I have been playing the game of basketball since I was 5 yrs old. I am the true definition of what they a “Hoop Head”.

 I have played basketball on all amateur levels to include semi-pro, played and coached with the All-Army basketball team. Through my many years of playing, I have come across many players that love the game as much as do. It is not uncommon for enthusiastic basketball players to wonder around a city or town hoping to find a pick-up game at a park, random gym and or some place that a friend of a friend said they were playing at.  
 
Body

The intended purpose for my proposed project is to simplify the way in which recreational sports players can connect. I want to eliminate having to get use the features from other applications just to paste or copy them into an application that does not support what you are trying to accomplish. My plan to complete this project will consist of compiling a list of requirements that will be needed to build a database that will support my application.

 In addition to building a database, I will need to create an Entity-Relationship Diagram, design a blueprint that will display the layout of the application and do more research on constructing an application that combines messaging, location and event creation functions. Strong consideration of my current tech skills will play a major role in the timeliness and success of this project. My plan is to start with the mindset of not going for the home run, but to complete small objectives and goals that will eventually lead to success. 

Conclusion

In summary, the application will provide users with the ability to find where people are regularly playing pickup games at parks, fitness centers, gyms and other locations created by a user. The plan is for the application to start locally in Phenix City, Columbus, Ga, and Fort Benning, Georgia. The user will have the features of a messaging system, location services, email and event creation at their fingertips within a few buttons clicks after initial registration. Additionally, the application will be enhanced to provide the same capabilities to perhaps volleyball, flag-football and bowling players.
